## Building
**Dependencies:** `zip`, `curl`, `awk`, JDK 17
```bash
sh build.sh curse  # curseforge zip
sh build.sh export # manual install zip
```

**Additional Instructions:**

<details>
<summary><b>For Windows 11:</b></summary>

1. Install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)  
   **TLDR:** Open PowerShell as admin and run `wsl --install`. This will likely require a reboot.
2. Open WSL by running `wsl` in the shell, then install `curl`, `git`, `zip`, and `openjdk-17-jdk`:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install make curl git zip openjdk-17-jdk
    ```
3. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eclipse-Ilx/Abyssal-Descent
    cd Abyssal-Descent
    ```
4. Run one of the build commands from above.

<details>
<summary><b>For Windows 10:</b></summary>

1. Install [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/)
2. Select `Install from Internet`, choosing the install location.
   Pick where you want the `Local Package Direcotry` to be,
   then select `Use System Proxy Settings` and choose a download site.
   (I don't think it matters which one you choose.)
3. Change `Pending` to `Full` and search for `git`, `gawk`, and `curl`.
   For each package change `Skip` to the latest version.
   Hit next, next, then finish.
   Be sure to make a shortcut when it asks you to, unless you're already familiar with Cygwin.
4. Download the MSI Installer for the [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and skip through the wizard.
5. Open `Cygwin64 Terminal`, then run the following commands.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eclipse-Ilx/Abyssal-Descent
   cd Abyssal-Descent
   ```
6. Run one of the build commands from above.
