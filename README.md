## Building
**Dependencies:** `make`, `curl`, `awk`, JDK 17
```bash
make all export # downloads mods, builds from source, applies overrides, and packages into a zip file
```

> **Note:**
> The zip generated by `make export` is just a naive archive of the `build` directory.
> It is not a valid modpack export whatever used by whichever launcher you use.
> (each of them has their own format and there's no way we're supportin em all :p)

**Additional Instructions:**

<details>
<summary><b>For Windows 11:</b></summary>

1. Install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)  
   **TLDR:** Open PowerShell as admin and run `wsl --install`. This will likely require a reboot.
2. Open WSL by running `wsl` in the shell, then install `make`, `curl`, `git`, and `openjdk-17-jdk`:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install make curl git openjdk-17-jdk
    ```
3. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eclipse-Ilx/Abyssal-Descent
    cd Abyssal-Descent
    ```

> **Note:**  
> Windows uses `\r\n` as line separators. If you've cloned the repo outside of WSL, you'll need to remove the `\r`.
> ```bash
> find . -type f -name Makefile -exec sed -i 's/\r//' {} \;
> ```

<summary><b>For Windows 10:</b></summary>

1. Install [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/)
2. Select `Install from Internet`, choosing the install location.
   Pick where you want the `Local Package Direcotry` to be,
   then select `Use System Proxy Settings` and choose a download site.
   (I don't think it matters which one you choose.)
3. Change `Pending` to `Full` and search for `git`, `make`, `gawk`, and `curl`.
   For each package change `Skip` to the latest version.
   Hit next, next, then finish.
   Be sure to make a shortcut when it asks you to, unless you're already familiar with Cygwin.
4. Download the MSI Installer for the [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and skip through the wizard.
5. Open `Cygwin64 Terminal`, then run the following commands (Right click to copy paste).
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eclipse-Ilx/Abyssal-Descent
   cd Abyssal-Descent
   make all
   ```
   This will build the pack, which will now be in the `build` directory.
