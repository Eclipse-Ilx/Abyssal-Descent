# What is Euphoria Patches?
Euphoria Patches is an add-on for Complementary Shaders, developed by SpacEagle17 and isuewo. It aims to extend Complementary with more optional handcrafted features and settings.
Please don't report any issues encountered using this add-on to EminGT.

# License notice:
Most of the code in this project is subject to the Complementary License Agreement 1.5 by EminGT and is therefore NOT allowed to be redistributed.

# Why does Euphoria Patches need a mod?
[Complementary's license](https://github.com/ComplementaryDevelopment/ComplementaryReimagined/blob/main/License.txt) does not allow us to publish our work as we do not have a "noticeably differen[ce] from the Original Pack in multiple common gameplay scenarios that must include daytime overworld visuals, regardless of the setting or variable changes in the Modified Pack and/or the Original Pack". We add onto Complementary so we don't fall into the green zone. We have had many conversations about this topic with Emin and came to a mutual agreement to distribute it through a patcher where none of Emin's code gets distributed (and by that not breaking the license) and the user has to have Complementary Shaders installed to get our add-on. All parties profit from this method.

Euphoria Patches Updates Immediately after a new Complementary Version is out. This includes dev versions. Euphoria Patches dev versions are available on **[Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/spaceagle17)** or **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/SpacEagle17)**!

# Euphoria Mod Support
Euphoria Patches aims to better support modded blocks than regular Complementary by having default modded block support (check block.properties). Light Source Detection with automatic applied emission. Foliage model detection with automatically applied SSS.

Euphoria Patches and also Complementary Shaders use iris-exclusive features which don't work on optifine. For the optimal experience, Iris is recommended. On Forge Oculus is for now recommended as it seems to support most iris-exclusive features.
