option.info1=How to get more performance
value.info1.0=
option.info1.comment=Performance is a complex topic in Minecraft because it gets affected by so many things, but you can try these:. Reduce your render distance, ideally it should be between 6 and 16 for almost every device. Reduce the "Profile" shader setting, these have been carefully tested for the best visual/performance ratio. More information will be added later.

option.info2=What are the best settings
value.info2.0=
option.info2.comment=Best settings are subjective, but using the default settings will be the near-best for most people. The default settings have been shaped by years of community evaluations and feedback, while paying a lot of attention to the visual/performance ratio. But you should still feel free to tweak around and have fun doing so!

option.info3=What is Profile or Visual Style
value.info3.0=
option.info3.comment="Profile" setting changes the settings found in the "Performance Settings" menu, while not affecting any preference-based settings. "Visual Style" changes the "Set by Style" values that exist on many preference-based settings, but it does not impact performance by an important amount.

option.info4=What is RP Support
value.info4.0=
option.info4.comment=RP Support option determines how the shader pack treats the different blocks of Minecraft. For example, §bIntegratedPBR+§r treats gold blocks as reflective things, while §elabPBR§r or §eseuspbr§r require you to install a resource pack to tell that to the shader. Setting RP Support to §aBasic§r will make it so that no block is "special" other than a couple exceptions like water.
