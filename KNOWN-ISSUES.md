# Critical / Game-Breaking

### Complementary Shaders
- TAA causes artifacting when looking into a immersive portal portal  
- Potential issues in the end on Linux, fuck nvidia
- bug in top left of screen when irradiated

### Performance
- Inexplicable lag spikes lasting 0.1-3 seconds.

### Other
- It's possible to enter a gap between the portal and ceiling of the dimension
- Possible issue when you get to the end your ears will be destroyed by an unknown sound

# Wontfix
- RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS) is not compatible with Sodium/embeddium [Fix](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Known-Issues#rtss-incompatible)  
- When a new layer comes into view with shaders you may get a lag spike. i.e mining a block revealing the new layers first block
- Sometimes a new dimension will just be transparent when you go to it. Press R to refresh shaders even if you have none toggled on
- When you grapple from one layer, into the next layer you bug out, grapple hook doesnt attach correctly or at all and you can fall through the world
