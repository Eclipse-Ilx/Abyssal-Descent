# Bugs/Issues

## Critical / Game-Breaking

## Visual
- Shader TAA causes artifacting when looking into a immersive portal portal  
- Potential shader related issues in the end on Linux, fuck nvidia
- fix all skyboxes for underground biomes (we want pitch black)
- shader bug in top left of screen when irradiated

## Performance
- Inexplicit lag spikes lasting few seconds.

## Other
- It's possible to enter a gap between the portal and ceiling of the dimension
- Possible issue when you get to the end your ears will be destroyed by an unknown sound

-----
## Wontfix
- RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS) is not compatible with Sodium/embeddium [Fix](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Known-Issues#rtss-incompatible)  
- When a new layer comes into view with shaders you may get a lag spike. i.e mining a block revealing the new layers first block
- Sometimes a new dimension will just be transparent when you go to it. Press R to refresh shaders even if you have none toggled on
