## Guide
+ Pathouli
	- grappling hook essential
	- make a mention of bedrock1 being breakable only with iron
	- name book item "We're sorry but you'll need this :)"
+ QOL Mods
	- Skin Layers 3d
	- sounds
	- backpack mod

## Universal
+ Textures for layer seperator blocks
+ Create low, medium, high and ultra shader presets while keeping the current shader settings and look intact
	- update complementary+euphoriapatches
	- we kinda have low already (mellow)
	- drop high and just have med+ultra?
+ Update mods that need to be updated
+ Custom Main menu
+ Potentially remove wooden armour
+ keepinventory only keep: curios, armour, pickaxe, grappling hook
+ balance kobold trades, add modded ones perhaps

## Polish
+ Disable Aether tips
+ fix a million pop ups upon world creation
+ Stop the alex's mobs book being given upon world creation

## Sequence Breaks

## ongoing WIP
+ further adjust biome size/frequency in custom dimensions

---

## Overworld
+ replace bedrock with adresources:bedrock1 without using block swap mod (not required for MVP)
+ Potentially descrease spawn rate of slimes?
+ make villages and loot related structures not spawn near 0,0
+ disable mobs - mammutilation

## Delver's Beginning
+ make sure pink salt shrines loot pool doesnt have stuff it shouldn't
+ add more structures - 
+ Change default blocks for biomes if possible. Ideally less deepslate fills this layer.
+ make small bioshrooms only generate on the right block
+ make geodes drop corresponding spelunkery raw drops


## The Undergarden
+ add textures for rough utherium and rough regalium

## Infernal Crossing
+ add structures -  feur bone tree, feur bone arc+ other pieces, feur fossil fang
+ balance mob spawn rates based on playtesting
